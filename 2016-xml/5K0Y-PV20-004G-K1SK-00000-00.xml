Any such trust indenture or other agreement, or the resolution providing for the issuance of bonds, may pledge or assign fees, rents and other charges to be received and may contain provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law. Such provisions may include covenants: (i) providing for the collection and application of revenues and the repossession and sale by the Authority, or any trustees under any trust indenture or agreement, of any project or other property upon default; (ii) setting forth duties of the Authority in relation to the acquisition, construction, maintenance, operation and insurance of any project or other property of the Authority and the amounts of fees, rents and other charges to be charged; (iii) providing for the collection of such fees, rents and other charges, and the custody, safeguarding and application of all moneys of the Authority; (iv) providing for the creation of sinking funds and the creation and maintenance of reserves; and (v) setting forth conditions or limitations with respect to the incurrence of indebtedness or the granting of mortgages or other liens. Such trust indenture, trust or other agreement or resolution may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee or other agent for bondholders and may restrict the individual right of action by bondholders.</p><p>In addition, the Authority may grant mortgages, deeds of trust, security interests and other liens on its real and personal property, including its accounts receivable, to secure bonds. All pledges of revenues of the Authority for payment of bonds shall be valid and binding from the time when the pledge is made, and the revenues pledged and thereafter received by the Authority shall be subject immediately to the lien of such pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act, and the lien of any such pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract or otherwise against the Authority, irrespective of whether such parties have notice thereof. The Authority may also provide for the recording or filing of any mortgage, deed of trust, security interest or other lien, or any financing statement or other instrument, necessary or desirable to create, perfect or evidence any lien created pursuant to this chapter.</p><p>It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company within or without the Commonwealth to serve as depository of the proceeds of bonds or of other revenues of the Authority and to furnish indemnifying bonds or to pledge such securities as may be required by the Authority.</p><p>All expenses incurred in carrying out the provisions of such trust indenture or agreement or resolution or other agreements relating to any project, including those to which the Authority may not be a party, may be treated as a part of the costs of a project.</p></bodyText><history><historyGroup groupType="history-citation"><historyItem><bodyText><p><citation normalizedCite="1996 VA CH 905"><content><span normalizedCite="1996 Va.
