A Uniform Standard shall become effective 90 days after its promulgation by the Commission or such later date as the Commission may determine; provided, however, that a Compacting State may opt out of a Uniform Standard as provided in this Article. "Opt out" shall be defined as any action by a Compacting State to decline to adopt or participate in a promulgated Uniform Standard.

A Compacting State may opt out of a Uniform Standard, either by legislation or regulation duly promulgated by the Insurance Department under the Compacting State's Administrative Procedure Act or duly promulgated pursuant to the Compacting State's law. If a Compacting State elects to opt out of a Uniform Standard by regulation, it must (a) give written notice to the Commission no later than 10 business days after the Uniform Standard is promulgated, or at the time the State becomes a Compacting State and (b) find that the Uniform Standard does not provide reasonable protections to the citizens of the State, given the conditions in the State. The Commissioner or tribunal shall make specific findings of fact and conclusions of law, based on a preponderance of the evidence, detailing the conditions in the State which warrant a departure from the Uniform Standard and determining that the Uniform Standard would not reasonably protect the citizens of the State. The Commissioner or tribunal must consider and balance the following factors and find that the conditions in the State and needs of the citizens of the State outweigh: (i) the intent of the legislature to participate in, and the benefits of, an interstate agreement to establish national uniform consumer protections for the Products subject to this Act; and (ii) the presumption that a Uniform Standard adopted by the Commission provides reasonable protections to consumers of the relevant Product.</p><p><pre/>Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Compacting State may, at the time of its enactment of this Compact, prospectively opt out of all Uniform Standards involving long-term care insurance products by expressly providing for such opt out in the enacted Compact, and such an opt out shall not be treated as a material variance in the offer or acceptance of any State to participate in this Compact. Such an opt out shall be effective at the time of enactment of this Compact by the Compacting State and shall apply to all existing Uniform Standards involving long-term care insurance products and those subsequently promulgated.</p></bodyText></level><level levelType="paragraph"><anchor id="_vii_5"/><heading><desig>5.</desig></heading><bodyText><p> Effect of Opt Out. If a Compacting State elects to opt out of a Uniform Standard, the Uniform Standard shall remain applicable in the Compacting State electing to opt out until such time the opt out legislation is enacted into law or the regulation opting out becomes effective.</p><p><pre/>Once the opt out of a Uniform Standard by a Compacting State becomes effective as provided under the laws of that State, the Uniform Standard shall have no further force and effect in that State unless and until the legislation or regulation implementing the opt out is repealed or otherwise becomes ineffective under the laws of the State. If a Compacting State opts out of a Uniform Standard after the Uniform Standard has been made effective in that State, the opt out shall have the same prospective effect as provided under Article XIV for withdrawals.</p></bodyText></level><level levelType="paragraph"><anchor id="_vii_6"/><heading><desig>6.</desig></heading><bodyText><p> Stay of Uniform Standard. If a Compacting State has formally initiated the process of opting out of a Uniform Standard by regulation, and while the regulatory opt out is pending, the Compacting State may petition the Commission, at least 15 days before the effective date of the Uniform Standard, to stay the effectiveness of the Uniform Standard in that State. The Commission may grant a stay if it determines the regulatory opt out is being pursued in a reasonable manner and there is a likelihood of success. If a stay is granted or extended by the Commission, the stay or extension thereof may postpone the effective date by up to 90 days, unless affirmatively extended by the Commission; provided, a stay may not be permitted to remain in effect for more than one year unless the Compacting State can show extraordinary circumstances which warrant a continuance of the stay, including, but not limited to, the existence of a legal challenge which prevents the Compacting State from opting out.
