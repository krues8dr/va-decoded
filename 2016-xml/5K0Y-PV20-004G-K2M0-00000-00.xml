Such officer shall be called "chairman" if a member of a board of supervisors and "mayor" if a member of a city or town council. Such member, if present, shall preside at the first meeting and all other meetings during the term for which so elected. The governing body also shall elect a vice-chairman or vice-mayor, as the case may be, who shall preside at meetings in the absence of the chairman or mayor and may discharge any duty of the chairman or mayor during his absence or disability. Chairmen and vice-chairmen, mayors and vice-mayors, may be so elected to serve for terms corresponding with their terms as supervisors or councilmen or may be elected for such other period as determined by the governing body. Whenever any board or council at the time of such election, fails to designate the specific term of office for which a chairman or vice-chairman, a mayor or vice-mayor, is elected, it shall be presumed that such officers were elected for a term of one year and shall serve until their successors have been elected and qualify.
