In such case, the contract shall provide that upon certificate of a faculty committee, the holder shall be relieved of his obligation to serve the Commonwealth as a soil scientist for a period equal to that during which he has been a beneficiary of such scholarship. Any applicant, upon being so relieved from the obligations imposed by such contract, shall arrange to reimburse the Commonwealth for the amount he has received on account of such scholarship plus interest on such amount computed at the prevailing rate charged on student loans at the school attended by the applicant. Provided, however, if such applicant, or any applicant who for any reason repays all or any part of the amount received of such scholarships, after reimbursing such amount plus interest to the Commonwealth, later fulfills the terms of his contract by completing his studies and serving the Commonwealth as a soil scientist for a period equal to that during which he received such scholarship, such applicant shall have reimbursed to him, from the general fund of the state treasury, the amount of the scholarship and interest previously repaid to the Commonwealth. This reimbursement shall be made on any contract made under the provisions of this section.</p></bodyText><history><historyGroup groupType="history-citation"><historyItem><bodyText><p>1970, c. 620.</p></bodyText></historyItem></historyGroup></history></level></statute></legislativeDocBody><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"><dc:identifier identifierScheme="PGUID">urn:contentItem:5K0Y-PT00-004G-K1WH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme="productContentSetIdentifier">10816</dc:source><dc:date dateType="last-updated">2016-06-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CODE OF VIRGINIA </publicationName><copyright>Copyright © 2016  by Matthew Bender &amp; Company, Inc. a member of the LexisNexis Group.
