The bylaws shall provide that one or more directors shall be appointed by the Director of the State Agricultural Extension Service. The director or directors so appointed shall be known as public directors. They need not be members of the association, or officers, directors or members of a member association, but shall have the same powers and rights as the directors elected by the members.
