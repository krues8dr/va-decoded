Such contract shall require the interim administrator to comply with any and all requirements established by the Department to ensure the health, safety, and welfare of the residents. Prior to or upon conclusion of the period of interim administration, management, or operation, an inspection shall be conducted to determine whether operation of the assisted living facility shall be permitted to continue or should cease. Such interim administration, management, or operation shall not be permitted when defects in the conditions of the premises of the assisted living facility (i) present imminent and substantial risks to the health, safety, and welfare of residents, and (ii) may not be corrected within a reasonable period of time. Any decision by the Commissioner to require the employment of a person to administer, manage, or operate an assisted living facility shall be subject to the rights of judicial review and appeal as provided in the Administrative Process Act (§ 2.2-4000 et seq.). Actual and reasonable costs of such interim administration shall be the responsibility of and shall be borne by the owner of the assisted living facility.</p></bodyText></level><level levelType="paragraph"><anchor id="_b"/><heading><desig>B.</desig></heading><bodyText><p> The Board shall adopt regulations for the Commissioner to use in determining when the imposition of administrative sanctions or initiation of court proceedings, severally or jointly, is appropriate in order to ensure prompt correction of violations in assisted living facilities and adult day care centers involving noncompliance with state law or regulation as discovered through any inspection or investigation conducted by the Departments of Social Services, Health, or Behavioral Health and Developmental Services. The Commissioner may impose such sanctions or take such actions as are appropriate for violation of any of the provisions of this subtitle or any regulation adopted under any provision of this subtitle that adversely affects the health, safety or welfare of an assisted living facility resident or an adult day care participant. Such sanctions or actions may include (i) petitioning the court to appoint a receiver for any assisted living facility or adult day care center and (ii) revoking or denying renewal of the license for the assisted living facility or adult day care center for violation of any of the provisions of this subtitle, § 54.1-3408 or any regulation adopted under this subtitle that violation adversely affects, or is an imminent and substantial threat to, the health, safety or welfare of the person cared for therein, or for permitting, aiding or abetting the commission of any illegal act in an assisted living facility or adult day care center.</p></bodyText></level><level levelType="paragraph"><anchor id="_c"/><heading><desig>C.</desig></heading><bodyText><p> The Commissioner may issue a summary order of suspension of the license to operate the assisted living facility pursuant to the procedures hereinafter set forth in conjunction with any proceeding for revocation, denial, or other action when conditions or practices exist that pose an imminent and substantial threat to the health, safety, and welfare of the residents. Before a summary order of suspension shall take effect, the Commissioner shall issue to the assisted living facility a notice of summary order of suspension setting forth (i) the procedures for the summary order of suspension, (ii) hearing and appeal rights as provided under this subsection, and (iii) facts and evidence that formed the basis for which the summary order of suspension is sought. Such notice shall be served on the assisted living facility or its designee as soon as practicable thereafter by personal service or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the address of record of the assisted living facility. The order shall state the time, date, and location of a hearing to determine whether the suspension is appropriate. Such hearing shall be presided over by a hearing officer selected by the Commissioner from a list prepared by the Executive Secretary of the Supreme Court of Virginia and shall be held as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 15 business days following service of the notice of hearing; however, the hearing officer may grant a written request for a continuance, not to exceed an additional 10 business days, for good cause shown. After such hearing, the hearing officer shall provide to the Commissioner written findings and conclusions, together with a recommendation whether the license should be summarily suspended, whereupon the Commissioner shall adopt the hearing officer's recommended decision unless to do so would be an error of law or Department policy. Any final agency case decision in which the Commissioner rejects a hearing officer's recommended decision shall state with particularity the basis for rejection. The Commissioner shall issue: (a) a final order of summary suspension or (b) an order that summary suspension is not warranted by the facts and circumstances presented. A final order of summary suspension shall include notice that the assisted living facility may appeal the Commissioner's decision to the appropriate circuit court no later than 10 days following service of the order. A copy of any final order of summary suspension shall be prominently displayed by the provider at each public entrance of the facility, or in lieu thereof, the provider may display a written statement summarizing the terms of the order in a prominent location, printed in a clear and legible size and typeface, and identifying the location within the facility where the final order of summary suspension may be reviewed.</p><p>Upon appeal, the sole issue before the court shall be whether the Department had reasonable grounds to require the assisted living facility to cease operations during the pendency of the concurrent revocation, denial, or other proceeding. Any concurrent revocation, denial, or other proceeding shall not be affected by the outcome of any hearing on the appropriateness of the summary order of suspension. Failure to comply with the summary order of suspension shall constitute an offense under subdivision 1 of <citation type="statute" normalizedCite="VACODE 63.2-1712"><content><span normalizedCite="Va.

In determining whether to deny, revoke, or summarily suspend a license, the Commissioner may choose to deny, revoke, or summarily suspend only certain authority of the assisted living facility to operate, and may restrict or modify the assisted living facility's authority to provide certain services or perform certain functions that the Commissioner determines should be restricted or modified in order to protect the health, safety, or welfare of the residents. Such denial, revocation, or summary suspension of certain services or functions may be appealed as otherwise provided in this subtitle for any denial, revocation, or summary suspension.</p></bodyText></level><history><historyGroup groupType="history-citation"><historyItem><bodyText><p>Code 1950, § 63-249; 1968, c. 578, § 63.1-212; <citation normalizedCite="1991 VA CH 532"><content><span normalizedCite="1991 Va.
