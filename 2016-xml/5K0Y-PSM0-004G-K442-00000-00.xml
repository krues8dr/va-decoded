The principal of, redemption premium, if any, and interest on such bonds shall be payable solely from, and may be secured solely by, a pledge of and lien upon the revenues, or any portion thereof, derived or to be derived by the authority from one or more of its projects, or contributions or advances from its members, or moneys derived from any source, as the authority shall determine. Bonds of the authority shall be authorized by a resolution adopted by its board of directors, and such resolution shall be spread upon its minutes. The bonds of each issue shall be dated, shall bear interest at such rate or rates, shall mature at such time or times not exceeding fifty years from their date or dates, shall have such rank or priority and may be made redeemable before maturity at the option of the authority, at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions, as may be determined by the authority. The authority shall determine the form of the bonds, including any interest coupons to be attached thereto, and the manner of execution of the bonds, and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the bonds and the place or places of payment of principal and interest, which may be at any bank or trust company within or outside the Commonwealth. In case any officer whose signature or a facsimile of whose signature appears on any bonds or coupons shall cease to be such officer before the delivery of such bonds, his signature or facsimile shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if he had remained in office until such delivery. The bonds may be issued in coupon or in registered form, or both, as the authority may determine, and provisions may be made for the registration of any coupon bonds as to principal alone and also as to both principal and interest, and for the reconversion into coupon bonds of any bonds registered as to both principal and interest. The authority may sell such bonds in such manner, either, at public or at private sale, and for such price as it may determine to be for the best interest of the authority and the member governmental units to be served thereby.</p><p>The issuance of such bonds shall not be subject to any limitations or conditions contained in any other law, and bonds may be issued without obtaining the consent of the Commonwealth or any political subdivisions, or of any agency, commission or instrumentality of either thereof, and without any other approvals, proceedings or the happening of any conditions or things other than those specifically required by this chapter and the provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or the trust agreement securing the same.</p></bodyText><history><historyGroup groupType="history-citation"><historyItem><bodyText><p>1979, c. 416, § 15.1-1615; <citation normalizedCite="1997 VA CH 587"><content><span normalizedCite="1997 Va.
