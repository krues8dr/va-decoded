Such notification must include a statement of the amount due, the nature of the proposed sale and the time and place of any public sale. The fact that a better price could have been obtained by a sale at a different time or in a different method from that selected by the warehouseman is not of itself sufficient to establish that the sale was not made in a commercially reasonable manner. If the warehouseman either sells the goods in the usual manner in any recognized market therefor, or sells at the price current in such market at the time of his sale, or has otherwise sold in conformity with commercially reasonable practices among dealers in the type of goods sold, he has sold in a commercially reasonable manner. A sale of more goods than apparently necessary to be offered to insure satisfaction of the obligation is not commercially reasonable except in cases covered by the preceding sentence.</p></bodyText></level><level levelType="paragraph"><anchor id="_2"/><heading><desig>(2)</desig></heading><bodyText><p> A warehouseman's lien on goods other than goods stored by a merchant in the course of his business may be enforced only as follows:</p></bodyText><level levelType="paragraph"><anchor id="_2_a"/><heading><desig>(a)</desig></heading><bodyText><p> All persons known to claim an interest in the goods must be notified.</p></bodyText></level><level levelType="paragraph"><anchor id="_2_b"/><heading><desig>(b)</desig></heading><bodyText><p> The notification must include an itemized statement of the claim, a description of the goods subject to the lien, a demand for payment within a specified time not less than 10 days after receipt of the notification, and a conspicuous statement that unless the claim is paid within that time the goods will be advertised for sale and sold by auction at a specified time and place.</p></bodyText></level><level levelType="paragraph"><anchor id="_2_c"/><heading><desig>(c)</desig></heading><bodyText><p> The sale must conform to the terms of the notification.</p></bodyText></level><level levelType="paragraph"><anchor id="_2_d"/><heading><desig>(d)</desig></heading><bodyText><p> The sale must be held at the nearest suitable place to that where the goods are held or stored.</p></bodyText></level><level levelType="paragraph"><anchor id="_2_e"/><heading><desig>(e)</desig></heading><bodyText><p> After the expiration of the time given in the notification, an advertisement of the sale must be published once a week for two weeks consecutively in a newspaper of general circulation where the sale is to be held.
