The Medical Center is authorized to make contributions for the benefit of its employees who are covered by any plan established pursuant to this section. Any such alternative retirement plans for Medical Center employees shall not become effective until such time as the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia may determine. Except as provided herein, all employees of the Medical Center who are employed by the Medical Center on or after July 1, 2000, shall be participants in a Medical Center retirement plan established pursuant to this section, with a contribution by the Medical Center at a rate to be determined by the University of Virginia Board of Visitors. However, an employee hired by the Medical Center on or after July 1, 2003, who, as of the first day of such employment, is a current member of the Virginia Retirement System defined benefit retirement plan established by this chapter shall elect to either: (i) continue to participate in such defined benefit retirement plan or (ii) choose the plan provided by the Medical Center with a contribution by the Medical Center at a rate to be determined by the University of Virginia Board of Visitors. Such election shall be exercised not later than 60 days from the time of the employee's entry into the performance of his duties for the Medical Center, and the election shall be irrevocable. During such 60-day period, to the time of such election, such employee shall participate in the Virginia Retirement System defined benefit retirement plan established by this chapter. If such election is not made within the time period provided in this subsection, such employee shall be deemed to have elected to participate in the retirement plan established by the Medical Center.</p></bodyText></level><level levelType="paragraph"><anchor id="_b"/><heading><desig>B.</desig></heading><bodyText><p> With respect to any employee of the Medical Center who elects to continue to participate in the Virginia Retirement System defined benefit retirement plan, the Medical Center shall collect and pay all employee and employer contributions due to the Virginia Retirement System for retirement and group life insurance in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 1 (<citation type="statute" normalizedCite="VACODE 51.1-124.1"><content><span normalizedCite="Va.
