In addition, (i) any three or more counties, cities or towns, or any combination thereof, operating a jail facility pursuant to an agreement for cooperative jailing established on or before January 31, 1993, (ii) any existing regional jail facilities established by only two cities, counties, or towns on or before June 30, 1982, and (iii) any regional jail facilities established by only two contiguous counties whose boundaries are not contiguous by land with the boundaries of any other county in the Commonwealth, may participate under the provisions of this section. The Board shall promulgate regulations specifying the categories of offenders which may be served pursuant to the contracts provided for herein.</p><p>The governing bodies of localities participating in an agreement for cooperative jailing shall create a board to advise the locality in which the jail facility is located on matters affecting operation of the facility. Each participating locality shall have at least one representative on the board. The sheriff and any member of the local governing body of each participating locality shall be eligible for appointment to the board; however, when a participating locality appoints more than one representative, the sheriff shall be appointed unless the sheriff is the administrator or superintendent of the jail facility operated pursuant to the agreement for cooperative jailing. A sheriff serving as such administrator or superintendent shall be an ex officio member of the board.</p><p>When such contracts are approved by the Board and, for the implementation of the contract, require the construction, enlargement, or renovation of a regional jail facility or the enlargement or renovation of an existing jail, the Commonwealth shall reimburse each such locality its pro rata share, up to one-half, of the capital costs, as defined in <citation type="statute" normalizedCite="VACODE 53.1-82.2"><content><span normalizedCite="Va.

The Department shall apply such regulations in preparing requests for appropriations. No such reimbursement shall be had unless the plans and specifications, including the need for additional personnel, thereof have been submitted to the Governor, and the jail project has been approved by him. The Governor shall base his approval in part on the expected operating cost-efficiency of the interior design of the facility.
