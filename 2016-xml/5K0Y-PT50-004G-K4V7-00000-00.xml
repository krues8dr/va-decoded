However, for a policy providing a varying amount of insurance issued on the life of a child under age ten, the equivalent uniform amount may be computed as though the amount of insurance provided by the policy prior to the attainment of age ten were the amount provided by the policy at age ten.</p></bodyText></level><level levelType="paragraph"><anchor id="_c"/><heading><desig>C.</desig></heading><bodyText><p> The adjusted premiums for any policy providing term insurance benefits by a rider or a supplemental policy provision shall equal (i) the adjusted premiums for an otherwise similar policy issued at the same age without the term insurance benefits, increased, during the period for which premiums for the term insurance benefits are payable by (ii) the adjusted premiums for the term insurance. Items (i) and (ii) of this subsection shall be calculated separately and as specified in subsections A and B of this section. For the purposes of items (ii), (iii), and (iv) of subsection A of this section, the amount of insurance or equivalent uniform amount of insurance used in the calculation of the adjusted premiums referred to in item (ii) of this subsection shall equal the excess of the corresponding amount determined for the entire policy over the amount used in the calculation of the adjusted premiums in item (i) of this subsection.</p></bodyText></level><history><historyGroup groupType="history-citation"><historyItem><bodyText><p>Code 1950, § 38-379; 1952, c. 317, § 38.1-464; 1962, c. 562; 1982, c. 228; 1986, c. 562.</p></bodyText></historyItem></historyGroup></history></level></statute></legislativeDocBody><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"><dc:identifier identifierScheme="PGUID">urn:contentItem:5K0Y-PT50-004G-K4V7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme="productContentSetIdentifier">10816</dc:source><dc:date dateType="last-updated">2016-06-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CODE OF VIRGINIA </publicationName><copyright>Copyright © 2016  by Matthew Bender &amp; Company, Inc. a member of the LexisNexis Group.
