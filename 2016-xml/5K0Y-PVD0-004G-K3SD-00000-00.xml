The opening phrase shall be in bold face, 10-point type as follows:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="it"> Loss of Time-Share Estate.</emphasis> Developer has inserted into this deed a "possibility of reverter." By this concept, should a grantee of this reverter deed default in or violate an obligation imposed by a consumer document for a period of at least 60 days and fail to cure such violation or default within no less than 30 calendar days thereafter, title to the time-share will revert back to the developer upon the developer recording an affidavit to this effect where this reverter deed is recorded. Only the developer can elect to exercise the possibility of reverter. Each grantee in this reverter deed will be sent at least two notices of default or violation within the 30-day period with no less than 10 days to cure in each instance. The notice will be sent to the address of each grantee maintained at the office of the developer or the association. After the cure period has lapsed and the developer records the affidavit, title to the time-share estate will automatically vest in the developer and any note executed by grantee will be deemed canceled and any recorded deed of trust securing such note shall be automatically released. The possibility of reverter will itself lapse and become null and void at the soonest to occur of the following: (i) the deed of trust is released of record, (ii) a statement that the deed of trust is released of record is executed and recorded by the developer with a date of when the possibility of reverter was or is to lapse, or (iii) when the time-share program terminates pursuant to either the Virginia Real Estate Time-Share Act or the time-share instrument which created such program.</p></bodyText></level><level levelType="paragraph"><anchor id="_f"/><heading><desig>F.</desig></heading><bodyText><p> The filing of the affidavit referred to in subdivision A 5 shall not result in the requirement of any filing under Chapter 12 (<citation type="statute" normalizedCite="VACODE 64.2-1200"><content><span normalizedCite="Va.
