No interest shall accrue on such principal or interest from the day the same is due. The Comptroller shall keep an account of all money thus paid into the state treasury, and it shall be paid to the individual partnership, association, or corporation entitled thereto upon satisfactory proof that such individual, partnership, association, or corporation is so entitled to such money. If the claim so presented is rejected by the Comptroller, the claimant may proceed against the Comptroller for recovery in the Circuit Court of the City of Richmond. An appeal from the judgment of the circuit court shall lie to the Supreme Court of Virginia as in actions at law, and all laws and rules relating to practice and procedure in actions at law shall apply to such authorized proceedings. No such proceedings shall be filed after 10 years from the day the principal of or interest on such bonds is due; however, if the individual having such claim is an infant or insane person or is imprisoned at such due date, such proceedings may be filed within five years after the removal of such disability, notwithstanding the fact that such 10-year period has expired.</p></bodyText></level><level levelType="paragraph"><anchor id="_b"/><heading><desig>B.</desig></heading><bodyText><p> The Authority may contract with the City of Richmond, the Counties of Henrico and Chesterfield, and the Department of State Police for the policing of any Authority facilities, and the City of Richmond, the Counties of Henrico and Chesterfield, and the Department of State Police are hereby authorized to enter into contracts with the Authority for such purpose.

The violation of any such regulation shall be punishable as follows: if such a violation would have been a violation of law if committed on any public highway in the City of Richmond or the County of Henrico or Chesterfield, it shall be punishable in the same manner as if it had been committed on such public highway; otherwise it shall be punishable as a Class 1 misdemeanor. All other police officers of the Commonwealth, the City of Richmond, and the Counties of Henrico and Chesterfield shall have the same powers and jurisdiction within the areas of operations agreed upon by the parties that they have beyond such limits and shall have access to all such areas at any time without interference for the purpose of exercising such powers and jurisdiction. For the purpose of enforcing such laws and regulations, the court having jurisdiction for the trial of criminal offenses committed in the City of Richmond or in the Counties of Henrico and Chesterfield within whose boundaries any crime is committed shall have jurisdiction to try any person charged with the violation of any such laws and regulations within such boundaries.
