The reduction shall continue until the member would have been eligible for normal retirement, based on age and service, had the member remained uninjured and employed. For the purposes of this section, <emphasis typeStyle="it">"income"</emphasis> means gross income received less deductions for social security taxes only.</p><p>Any person receiving pensions or benefits under the provisions of this section shall upon request, on or before May 1 of each year, provide a copy of all W-2 forms showing income received, or a statement under oath as to whether the member has received compensation for work performed in the previous calendar year, to the governing body of the jurisdiction providing this pension.  Refusal to provide such documents shall be grounds for termination of benefits under this section until such documents are produced.  Production of the documents shall be required until the person would have been eligible for normal retirement had the member remained uninjured.</p><p>Nothing contained in this section shall limit or restrict the right of any person to receive Workers' Compensation benefits under Title 65.2.</p></bodyText><history><historyGroup groupType="history-citation"><historyItem><bodyText><p>1983, c. 351, § 51-122.3; <citation normalizedCite="1990 VA CH 832"><content><span normalizedCite="1990 Va.
