In addition, (i) any regional jail facilities established by three or more cities, counties or towns, or any combination thereof, on or before January 31, 1993, (ii) any existing regional jail facilities established by only two cities, counties or towns on or before June 30, 1982, and (iii) any regional jail facilities established by only two contiguous counties whose boundaries are not contiguous by land with the boundaries of any other county in the Commonwealth, may participate under the provisions of this section.

However, regional jails created by any combination of three or more cities or counties on or after February 1, 1993, shall not be eligible for such reimbursement unless at least three of the participating localities of such combination were each operating a jail on February 1, 1993. The Board shall promulgate regulations, to include criteria which may be used to assess need and establish priorities, to serve as guidelines in evaluating requests for such reimbursement and to ensure the fair and equitable distribution of state funds provided for such purpose. The Department shall apply such regulations in preparing requests for appropriations. No such reimbursement shall be had unless the plans and specifications, including the need for additional personnel, thereof have been submitted to the Governor and the jail project has been approved by him. The Governor shall base his approval in part on the expected operating cost-efficiency of the interior design of the facility.

In such case, the Department shall receive such costs from the funds appropriated in the general appropriation act for criminal costs. The method of operation by the Department shall be in the manner it prescribes, notwithstanding any other provision of law designating sheriffs as the keepers of jails.</p><p>In lieu of an agreement by the localities with the Board for construction or operation of jail facilities, the Board may agree to sell land owned by the Commonwealth to the localities.
