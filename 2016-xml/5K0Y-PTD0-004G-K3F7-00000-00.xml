A declarant may voluntarily surrender the right to appoint and remove officers and members of the executive board before termination of that period, but in that event he may require, for the duration of the period of declarant control, that specified actions of the association or executive board, as described in a recorded instrument executed by the declarant, be approved by the declarant before they become effective.</p></bodyText></level><level levelType="paragraph"><anchor id="_e"/><heading><desig>E.</desig></heading><bodyText><p> Not later than 60 days after conveyance of 25 percent of the cooperative interests which may be created to proprietary lessees other than a declarant, at least one member and not less than 25 percent of the members of the executive board must be elected by proprietary lessees other than the declarant.
