The governing body of any such city shall have the authority to terminate any one or more of such authorities and continue any other single authority, as a consolidated authority in which case any terminated authority shall cease to exist except for the purpose of winding up its affairs and executing the necessary documents for the transfer of its respective assets and liabilities, if any, to the new consolidated or surviving authority. If a new or consolidated authority is created, its membership shall be composed of seven commissioners, five of whom shall be the commissioners presently serving under existing law under any authority created within such city, and two of whom shall be commissioners selected from the other authority or the authority that is terminated. Each such commissioner shall continue to serve for the term for which he was appointed or until his successor has been appointed and has qualified.</p></bodyText><history><historyGroup groupType="history-citation"><historyItem><bodyText><p>1972, c. 124.</p></bodyText></historyItem></historyGroup></history></level></statute></legislativeDocBody><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"><dc:identifier identifierScheme="PGUID">urn:contentItem:5K0Y-PT30-004G-K3TG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme="productContentSetIdentifier">10816</dc:source><dc:date dateType="last-updated">2016-06-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CODE OF VIRGINIA </publicationName><copyright>Copyright © 2016  by Matthew Bender &amp; Company, Inc. a member of the LexisNexis Group.
