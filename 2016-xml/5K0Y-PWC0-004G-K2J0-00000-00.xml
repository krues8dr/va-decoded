The hearing shall consider whether the residents and owners of real property within the proposed district would benefit from the establishment of the proposed district. All interested persons who either reside in or own taxable real property within the proposed district shall have the right to appear and show cause why any property or properties should not be included in the proposed district. If real property within a town is included in the proposed district, a copy of the petition and notice of the public hearing shall be delivered to the town council at least 30 days prior to the public hearing, and the town council may by resolution determine if the town council wishes any property located within the town to be included within the proposed district and any such resolution shall be delivered to the governing body prior to the public hearing required by this section. Such resolution shall be binding upon the governing body with respect to the inclusion or exclusion of such properties within the proposed district. If that resolution permits any commercial or industrial property located within a town to be included in the proposed district, then if requested to do so by the petition the town council of any town that has adopted a zoning ordinance also shall pass a resolution, to be effective upon creation of the proposed district, that is consistent with the requirements of subsection E with respect to commercial and industrial zoning classifications that shall be in force in that portion of the town included in the district. The petition shall comply with the provisions of this section with respect to minimum acreage or assessed valuation. Notice of the hearing shall be given by publication once a week for three consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation within the locality. At least 10 days shall intervene between the third publication and the date set for the hearing. Such public hearing may be adjourned from time to time.</p></bodyText></level><level levelType="paragraph"><anchor id="_d"/><heading><desig>D.</desig></heading><bodyText><p> If the governing body finds the creation of the proposed district would be in furtherance of the county's comprehensive plan for the development of the area, in the best interests of the residents and owners of real property within the proposed district, and in furtherance of the public health, safety, and welfare, the governing body may pass a resolution that is reasonably consistent with the petition, that creates the district upon final adoption, and that provides for the appointment of an advisory board in accordance with this chapter upon final adoption.
