Such expense allowance shall constitute a cost of operation and maintenance of such utility systems and shall be prorated among each of the systems it manages using the "Three-Factor" allocation method approved by the Commission. The three factors consist of the percentages that each division comprises of total plant in service, total operating revenues, and total customer accounts. Once each operating division's percentage of each of the three factors is calculated, the sum of the three factors divided by three results in the operating division's share of the total direct or indirect costs.</p></bodyText></level><history><historyGroup groupType="history-citation"><historyItem><bodyText><p><citation normalizedCite="2010 VA CH 117"><content><span normalizedCite="2010 Va.
