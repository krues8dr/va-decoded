The Fund shall be administered and managed by the Authority as prescribed in this chapter, subject to the right of the Board, following consultation with the Authority, to direct the distribution of loans, loan subsidies (including principal forgiveness) or grants from the Fund to particular local governments or other entities and to establish the interest rates and repayment terms and those public health conditions deemed necessary by the Board of such loans, loan subsidies or grants as provided in this chapter. In order to carry out the administration and management of the Fund, the Authority is granted the power to employ officers, employees, agents, advisers and consultants, including, without limitation, attorneys, financial advisers, engineers and other technical advisers and public accountants and, the provisions of any other law to the contrary notwithstanding, to determine their duties and compensation without the approval of any other agency or instrumentality.
