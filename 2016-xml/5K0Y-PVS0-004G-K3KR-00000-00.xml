The publication shall include a notice that any creditor therein named who fails to apply to the disbursing official for payment of the amount due him within six months from the date of the last publication of such notice will be barred from his right thereafter to receive payment of amounts then due and from participation in any future dividends or payments that may thereafter be ordered.</p></bodyText><history><historyGroup groupType="history-citation"><historyItem><bodyText><p>Code 1950, § 6-58; 1966, c. 584, § 6.1-106; <citation normalizedCite="2010 VA CH 794"><content><span normalizedCite="2010 Va.
