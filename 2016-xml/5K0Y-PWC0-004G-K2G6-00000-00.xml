Such ordinances shall be filed with the Secretary of the Commonwealth and, upon certification by that officer to the Tax Commissioner and the governing body of each of the participating counties and cities that the ordinances required by this chapter have been filed and, upon the basis of the facts set forth therein, satisfy such requirements, the territory defined in such ordinances, upon the entry of such certification in the minutes of the proceedings of the governing body of each of the counties and cities, shall be and constitute a transportation district for all of the purposes of this chapter, known and designated by the name stated in the ordinances.</p></bodyText></level><level levelType="paragraph"><anchor id="_b"/><heading><desig>B.</desig></heading><bodyText><p> Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection A, any county or city may, subject to the applicable provisions of this chapter, constitute itself a transportation district in the event that no governing body of any contiguous county or city wishes to combine for such purpose, provided that the governing body of such single locality transportation district shall comply with the provisions of subsection A by adopting an ordinance that (i) sets forth the name of the proposed transportation district, which shall include the words "transit district" or "transportation district"; (ii) fixes, in such county or city, the boundaries thereof; (iii) names the county or city that is in whole or in part to be embraced therein; and (iv) contains a finding that the orderly growth and development of the county or city and the comfort, convenience, and safety of its citizens require an improved transportation district, composed of transit facilities, public highways, and other modes of transport, and that joint action with contiguous counties and cities has not been agreed to at this time, but that the formation of a transportation district will facilitate the planning and development of the needed transportation system, and shall file such ordinance in the manner and mode required by subsection A.
