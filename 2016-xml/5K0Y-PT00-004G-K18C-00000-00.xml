The amount when decided upon by the judge of the court, after conferring with the engineer, shall be entered as an order of record in the drainage record. The viewers, other than the engineer, shall receive five dollars per day each. The transitmen, rodmen, chainmen, axemen, and other laborers shall receive wages not to exceed the wages current at the time in the locality for such services. The members of the board of viewers shall receive, from time to time, out of the respective drainage project funds, such compensation as the court shall determine to be reasonable for the time expended and services performed by them on each project. All other fees and costs incurred under the provisions of this chapter shall be the same, as provided by law for like services in other cases, or as fixed by the court if not provided by law. The costs and expenses shall be paid by order of the court out of the proper project drainage fund provided for that purpose, and the board of viewers shall issue warrants therefor when funds of a drainage project, for which service shall have been rendered, shall be in the hands of the treasurer or treasurers.</p></bodyText><history><historyGroup groupType="history-citation"><historyItem><bodyText><p>Code 1919, § 1778; 1924, p. 707; 1926, p. 627; 1954, c. 642.</p></bodyText></historyItem></historyGroup></history></level></statute></legislativeDocBody><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"><dc:identifier identifierScheme="PGUID">urn:contentItem:5K0Y-PT00-004G-K18C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme="productContentSetIdentifier">10816</dc:source><dc:date dateType="last-updated">2016-06-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CODE OF VIRGINIA </publicationName><copyright>Copyright © 2016  by Matthew Bender &amp; Company, Inc. a member of the LexisNexis Group.
