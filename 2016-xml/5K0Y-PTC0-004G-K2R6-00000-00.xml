During such period liens or encumbrances shall arise or be created and enforced only against each apartment and the percentage of undivided interest in the common areas and facilities appurtenant to such apartment in the same manner and under the same conditions in every respect as liens or encumbrances may arise or be created upon or against any other separate parcel of real property subject to individual ownership; provided, that no labor performed or materials furnished with the consent or at the request of an apartment owner or his agent or his contractor or subcontractor, shall be the basis for the filing of a mechanic's lien against the apartment or any other property of any other apartment owner not expressly consenting to or requesting the same, except that such express consent shall be deemed to be given by the owner of any apartment in the case of emergency repairs thereto. Labor performed or materials furnished for the common areas and facilities, if duly authorized by the council of co-owners, the manager, or board of directors in accordance with this chapter, the master deed, or bylaws, shall be deemed to be performed or furnished with the express consent of each apartment owner and shall be the basis for the filing of a mechanic's lien against each of the apartments and shall be subject to the provisions of subparagraph (b) hereunder.

Said individual payment, or amount of bond, shall be computed by reference to the percentage established pursuant to the bylaws of the horizontal property regime. After such partial payment, filing of bond, partial discharge, or release, or other satisfaction, the apartment and its percentage interest in the common elements shall thereafter be free and clear of such lien. Such partial payment, indemnity, satisfaction, or discharge shall not prevent the lienor from proceeding to enforce his rights against any apartment and its percentage interest in the common elements not so paid, indemnified, satisfied, or discharged.</p></bodyText></level><history><historyGroup groupType="history-citation"><historyItem><bodyText><p>1966, c. 683.</p></bodyText></historyItem></historyGroup></history></level></statute></legislativeDocBody><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"><dc:identifier identifierScheme="PGUID">urn:contentItem:5K0Y-PTC0-004G-K2R6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme="productContentSetIdentifier">10816</dc:source><dc:date dateType="last-updated">2016-06-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CODE OF VIRGINIA </publicationName><copyright>Copyright © 2016  by Matthew Bender &amp; Company, Inc. a member of the LexisNexis Group.
