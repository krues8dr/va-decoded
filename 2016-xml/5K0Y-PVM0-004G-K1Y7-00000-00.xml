A person purchasing cigarettes for resale shall not be in violation of this section (a) if at the time of such purchase the manufacturer and brand families of the cigarettes are included in the Directory and the cigarettes are otherwise lawfully stamped and sold within 45 days of the date such manufacturer and brand families were removed from the Directory or (b) if, in the case of a retailer, the cigarettes are sold or delivered to consumers within 45 days after receipt of delivery of such cigarettes from a wholesaler, which cigarettes otherwise have been lawfully purchased from the same wholesaler. A tobacco product manufacturer that is otherwise in compliance with the requirements of this chapter may, for reasons satisfactory to the Attorney General, request removal of itself, or cigarettes in a brand family that it manufactures or has manufactured, from the Directory. A person purchasing cigarettes for resale shall not be in violation of this section if (1) at the time of such purchase, the manufacturer and brand families of the cigarettes are included in the Directory and the cigarettes are otherwise lawfully stamped and sold within 60 days of the date such cigarettes were removed from the Directory or (2) in the case of a retailer, the cigarettes are sold or delivered to consumers within 60 days after receipt of delivery of such cigarettes from a wholesaler and the cigarettes have been lawfully purchased from the same wholesaler.
