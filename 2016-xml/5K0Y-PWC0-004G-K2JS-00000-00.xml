Such proceedings shall be in accordance with and subject to the provisions of any and all laws applicable to condemnation of property in the name of the Commissioner of Highways under the laws of the Commonwealth. Title to any property acquired by the Commission shall be taken in the name of the District. In any condemnation proceedings, the court having jurisdiction of the suit, action, or proceeding may make such orders as may be just to the Commission and to the owners of the property to be condemned and may require an undertaking or other security to secure such owners against any loss or damage by reason of the failure of the Commission to accept and pay for the property, but neither such undertaking or security nor any act or obligation of the Commission shall impose any liability upon the District except as may be paid from the funds provided under the authority of this chapter.</p><p>If the owner, lessee, or occupier of any property to be condemned refuses to remove his personal property therefrom or give up possession thereof, the Commission may proceed to obtain possession in any manner provided by law.</p><p>With respect to any railroad property or right-of-way upon which railroad tracks are located, any powers of condemnation or of eminent domain may be exercised to acquire only an easement interest therein, which is located either sufficiently far above or sufficiently far below the grade of any railroad track upon such railroad property so that neither the proposed project nor any part thereof, including any bridges, abutments, columns, supporting structures, and appurtenances, nor any traffic upon it interferes in any manner with the use, operation, or maintenance of the trains, tracks, works, or appurtenances or other property of the railroad nor endanger the movement of the trains or traffic upon the tracks of the railroad. Prior to the institution of condemnation proceedings for such easement over or under such railroad property or right-of-way, plans and specifications of the proposed project showing compliance with the above-mentioned above or below grade requirements and showing sufficient and safe plans and specifications of such overhead or undergrade structure and appurtenances shall be submitted to the railroad for examination and approval. If the railroad fails or refuses within 30 days to approve the plans and specifications so submitted, the matter shall be submitted to the State Corporation Commission, as to the sufficiency and safety of such plans and specifications and as to such elevations or distances above or below the tracks. Said overhead or undergrade structure and appurtenances shall be constructed only in accordance with such plans and specifications and in accordance with such elevations or distances above or below the tracks so approved by the railroad or the State Corporation Commission. A copy of the plans and specifications approved by the railroad or the State Corporation Commission shall be filed as an exhibit with the petition for condemnation. The cost of any such overhead or undergrade projects and appurtenances and any expense and cost incurred in changing, adjusting, relocating, or removing the lines and grades of such railroad in connection with the project shall be paid by the Commission as a part of the cost of the project.</p></bodyText><history><historyGroup groupType="history-citation"><historyItem><bodyText><p>1956, c. 714; <citation normalizedCite="2014 VA CH 805"><content><span normalizedCite="2014 Va.
