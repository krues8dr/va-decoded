If any material disagreements occur in the planning process with respect to objectives and goals, the evaluation of basic data, or the selection of criteria and standards to be applied in the planning process, the commission shall exert its best efforts to bring about agreement and understanding on such matters. The commission may hold hearings in an effort to resolve any such basic controversies.</p></bodyText></level><level levelType="paragraph"><anchor id="_4"/><heading><desig>4.</desig></heading><bodyText><p> Before a transportation plan is adopted, altered, revised, or amended by the commission or by an agency on which it is represented, the commission shall transmit such proposed plan, alteration, revision, or amendment to the governing bodies of the component governments, to the Commonwealth Transportation Board, and to its technical committees and shall release to the public information with respect thereto. A copy of the proposed transportation plan, amendment, or revision shall be kept at the commission office and shall be available for public inspection. Upon 30 days' notice, published once a week for two successive weeks in one or more newspapers of general circulation within the transportation district, a public hearing shall be held on the proposed plan, alteration, revision, or amendment. The 30 days' notice period shall begin to run on the first day the notice appears in any such newspaper. The commission shall consider the evidence submitted and statements and comments made at such hearings and, if objections in writing to the whole or any part of the plan are made by the governing body of any component government, or by the Commonwealth Transportation Board, or if the commission considers any written objection made by any other person, group, or organization to be sufficiently significant, the commission shall reconsider the plan, alteration, revision, or amendment. If, upon reconsideration, the commission agrees with the objection, then the commission shall make appropriate changes to the proposed plan, alteration, revision, or amendment and may adopt them without further hearing. If, upon reconsideration, the commission disagrees with the objection, the commission may adopt the plan, alteration, revision, or amendment. No facilities shall be located in and no service rendered, however, within any county or city that does not execute an appropriate agreement with the commission or with an interstate agency as provided in <citation type="statute" normalizedCite="VACODE 33.2-1922"><content><span normalizedCite="Va.
