preparing for and hosting the Olympic Games will have a positive economic impact on the region, including:</p></bodyText><level levelType="paragraph"><anchor

id="_i_b_4"/><heading><desig>4.</desig></heading><bodyText><p> The citizens of the region have responded positively to WBRC 2012's efforts and solidly embraced the cause to host the Olympic Games, expressed in part by the endorsement of scores of local business, civic, governmental, academic, and amateur sports organizations, and by survey results that show (i) eighty-two percent of the region's residents support the effort to bring the 2012 Olympic Games to this area and (ii) eighty-six percent of area residents believe that the Olympic Games will bring substantial economic benefits to our region.</p></bodyText></level><level levelType="paragraph"><anchor id="_i_b_5"/><heading><desig>5.</desig></heading><bodyText><p> Through the submission of the region's official bid proposal to the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) on December 15, 2000, WBRC 2012 reached a milestone in the process of capturing the Olympic Games by providing a 631-page logistical, operational, and financial blueprint for hosting the 2012 Games.</p></bodyText></level><level levelType="paragraph"><anchor id="_i_b_6"/><heading><desig>6.</desig></heading><bodyText><p> The bid proposal highlights the great venues and vistas found in our region and is developed around key principles, including (i) building less, not more and (ii) utilizing mass transit, and (iii) protecting the environment.</p></bodyText></level><level levelType="paragraph"><anchor id="_i_b_7"/><heading><desig>7.</desig></heading><bodyText><p> In addition to the region's bid proposal, the USOC and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) require certain government guarantees and commitments in conjunction with hosting the 2012 Olympic Games, should our region win the U.S. Candidate City designation.</p></bodyText></level><level levelType="paragraph"><anchor id="_i_b_8"/><heading><desig>8.</desig></heading><bodyText><p> Our unique regional approach to winning the right to host the

and maximizes the region's chances of winning the 2012 Olympic Games, and reaping the many benefits that come with this honor.</p></bodyText></level><level levelType="paragraph"><anchor id="_i_b_10"/><heading><desig>10.</desig></heading><bodyText><p> Given that all four jurisdictions, Virginia, Maryland, the District of Columbia, and Baltimore, will host a significant number of events and reap substantial benefits, the most effective solution for all four jurisdictions is to enter into a single agreement that gives the USOC (and subsequently the IOC) a single focal point and a united front that reflects the regional nature of our bid.</p></bodyText></level></level></level><level levelType="article"><anchor id="_ii"/><heading><desig>Article II.</desig></heading><level
