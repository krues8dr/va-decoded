If state hospital or training center staff identify an individual as ready for discharge and the community services board that is responsible for the individual's care disagrees, the community services board shall document in the treatment plan within 30 days of the individual's identification any reasons for not accepting the individual for discharge. If the state hospital or training center disagrees with the community services board and the board refuses to develop a discharge plan to accept the individual back into the community, the state hospital or training center or the community services board shall ask the Commissioner to review the state hospital's or training center's determination that the individual is ready for discharge in accordance with procedures established by the Department in collaboration with state hospitals, training centers, and community services boards. If the Commissioner determines that the individual is ready for discharge, a discharge plan shall be developed by the Department to ensure the availability of adequate services for the individual and the protection of the community. The Commissioner also shall verify that sufficient state-controlled funds have been allocated to the community services board through the performance contract. If sufficient state-controlled funds have been allocated, the Commissioner may contract with a private provider, another community services board, or a behavioral health authority to deliver the services specified in the discharge plan and withhold allocated funds applicable to that individual's discharge plan from the community services board in accordance with subsections C and E of <citation type="statute" normalizedCite="VACODE 37.2-508"><content><span normalizedCite="Va.
