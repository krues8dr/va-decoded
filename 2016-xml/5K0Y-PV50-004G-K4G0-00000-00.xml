In the event that the agreement between a client company and a professional employer organization is terminated, the coemployees shall become solely the employees of the former client company. If the coemployees have been covered as employees of the professional employer organization under a voluntary market workers' compensation insurance policy for a period of three consecutive years or more, the workers' compensation insurance premium applicable to the policy of the former client company shall be based upon the rating of the professional employer organization until the former client employer has developed sufficient experience to be rated on its own or no longer qualifies for experience rating. If the coemployees have been covered as employees of the professional employer organization for a period of less than three consecutive years, the workers' compensation insurance premium applicable to the policy of the former client company shall be based upon the experience of the former client company which reflects its experience during the experience period specified by the approved experience rating plan, including, if available, experience incurred for coemployees under the professional employer services agreement.</p></bodyText></level><level levelType="paragraph"><anchor id="_b"/><heading><desig>B.</desig></heading><bodyText><p> Insurers may conduct periodic audits of any professional employer organization, including payrolls, operations and records as related to individual client company operations in order to ensure that the appropriate premium is charged for workers' compensation insurance coverage.
