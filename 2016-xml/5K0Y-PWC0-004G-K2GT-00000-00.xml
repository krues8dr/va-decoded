The bonds and other obligations of a district (and such bonds and obligations shall so state on their face) shall not be a debt of the Commonwealth or any political subdivision thereof, and only the district shall be liable thereon.

The commission shall determine the form of the bonds, including any interest coupons to be attached and the manner of execution of the bonds, and shall fix the denominations of the bonds and the places of payment of principal and interest, which may be at any bank or trust company within or outside the Commonwealth. If any officer whose signature or facsimile signature appears on any bonds or coupons ceases to be such officer before delivery of such bond, such signature or facsimile shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if he had remained in office until such delivery. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this article or any recitals in any bonds issued under the provisions of this article, all such bonds shall be negotiable instruments under the laws of the Commonwealth. The bonds may be issued in coupon or registered form or both, as the commission may determine, and provision may be made for the registration of any coupon bonds as to principal alone and also as to both principal and interest, and for the reconversion into coupon bonds of any bonds registered as to both principal and interest. The transportation district may sell such bonds in such manner, either at public or private sale, and for such price as it may determine to be for the best interests of the district. A transportation district is authorized to enter into indentures or agreements with respect to all such matters, and such indentures or agreements may contain such other provisions as the commission may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. The resolution may provide that the bonds shall be payable from and secured by all or any part of the revenues, moneys, or funds of the district as specified therein. Such pledge shall be valid and binding from the time the pledge is made, and such revenues, moneys, and funds so pledged and thereafter received by the district shall immediately be subject to the lien of such pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act. The lien of any such pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract, or otherwise against the district, irrespective of whether such parties have notice thereof. Neither the resolution nor any trust indenture by which a pledge is created need be filed or recorded except in the records of the district. All expenses incurred in carrying out the provisions of such indentures or agreements may be treated as a purpose of the transportation district. A transportation district may issue refunding bonds for the purpose of redeeming or retiring any bonds before or at maturity, including the payment of any premium, accrued interest, and costs or expenses thereof.</p></bodyText></level><level levelType="paragraph"><anchor id="_b_2"/><heading><desig>2.</desig></heading><bodyText><p> Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds a transportation district may, under like restrictions, issue interim receipts or temporary bonds, with or without coupons, exchangeable for definitive bonds when such bonds have been executed and are available for delivery.

Such bonds are securities that may properly and legally be deposited with and received by any state or local officer or any agency or governmental subdivision of the Commonwealth for any purpose for which the deposit of bonds or obligations is now or may hereafter be authorized by law.</p></bodyText></level><history><historyGroup groupType="history-citation"><historyItem><bodyText><p>1968, c. 551, ยง 15.1-1358.2; 1972, c. 791; <citation normalizedCite="1997 VA CH 587"><content><span normalizedCite="1997 Va.
