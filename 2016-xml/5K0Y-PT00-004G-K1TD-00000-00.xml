Such trust indenture or the resolution providing for the issuance of such bonds may pledge or assign all or any part of the funds of the Authority available for such purpose, including, but without limitation, (i) payments of principal of and interest on educational institution bonds purchased by the Authority, (ii) proceeds of the sale of any such educational institution bonds, (iii) payments of principal of and interest on obligations transferred to the Authority by the General Assembly or from other assets or moneys transferred to the Authority by the General Assembly or educational institutions, including lease payments and other sources of revenue, (iv) proceeds of the sale of any such obligations or assets, (v) proceeds from the sale of bonds of the Authority, (vi) security interests granted by the Authority or any educational institution in, or other liens on, equipment, whether such equipment has been leased or sold to an educational institution, (vii) all or any part of the payments due the Authority from educational institutions under any leases, sale agreements, loans or other agreements made by the Authority with the educational institutions pursuant to <citation type="statute" normalizedCite="VACODE 23-30.27:1"><content><span normalizedCite="Va.

Such trust indenture or resolution may also pledge or assign any other rights of the Authority in equipment owned by, or leases or sales of equipment made by, the Authority. Such trust indenture or resolution providing for the issuance of such bonds may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law. Such trust indenture or resolution providing for the issuance of such bonds may provide for the creation and maintenance of such reserves as the Authority shall determine to be proper, and may include covenants setting forth the duties of the Authority in relation to the acquisition of any equipment or educational institution bonds; the care, leasing or sale of equipment to educational institutions; the substitution of any educational institution bonds, equipment, leases, security interest or other security as security for the payment of the bonds of the Authority; care, use and insurance of equipment; the repossession and sale of leased or sold equipment by the Authority or the trustee under any trust indenture upon any default under the lease or sale of such equipment; and the collection of payments due the Authority under leases or agreements of sale of equipment and payments of principal and interest on any educational institution bonds and on any obligations or other assets held by the Authority. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth which may act as depository of the proceeds of bonds or of revenues to furnish such indemnifying bonds or to pledge such securities as may be required by the Authority. Any such trust indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and the trustee, and may restrict the individual right of action by bondholders. In addition to the foregoing, any such trust indenture or resolution may contain such other provisions as the Authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out the provisions of such trust indenture or resolution may be treated as a part of the administration costs of the Authority. Neither the resolution nor any trust indenture by which a pledge is created need be filed or recorded except in the records of the Authority.</p></bodyText><history><historyGroup groupType="history-citation"><historyItem><bodyText><p>1964, c. 607; 1966, c. 685; 1986, c. 597; <citation normalizedCite="1996 VA CH 672"><content><span normalizedCite="1996 Va.
